# 2 Convolution and HRTF

## Impulse Response

In signal processing, the impulse response, or impulse response function (IRF), of a system is its output when presented with a brief input signal, called an impulse.

## Convolution Theory

### Time Domain Convolution (Buffer-based)

#### long IR buffer requires a lof CPU resource

### FFT Convolution

in frequency domain we can perform also the convolution but it's significantly more CPU-efficient especially for long buffer.

Max implementation of fft doesn't allow us to convolve longer than FFT size.

Input signal is convolved with a sampled IR. This creates very realistic and natural reverb sound, compared to algorithmic reverb effects.
