#3 Convolution and HRTF

## HRTF

HRTF ... Head Related Transfer Function

HRTF characterizes how an ear receives a sound from a point in space. As sound strikes the listener, the size and shape of the head, ears, ear canal, density of the head, size and shape of nasal and oral cavities, all transform the sound and affect how it is perceived, boosting some frequencies and attenuating others. Obviously, the HRTF varies person to person.

## Dummy head

enables us to record very realistic spatial sound because dummy head simulates ITD, ILD, and HRTF.

## HRIR 

HRIR ... Head Related Impulse Response

Usually a set of impulse response data that represents how an impulse in modified by head by reaching the ear canals. The HRTF is the Fourier transform of HRIR.

## The SOFA file

SOFA ...Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics

SOFA is a file format for storing spatially oriented acoustic data like head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and binaural or spatial room impulse responses (BRIRs, SRIRs). SOFA has been standardized by the Audio Engineering Society (AES) as AES69-2015.
