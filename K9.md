#9 Towards the final project

### Head-Tracking

If the sound source is in front of you and your if turn right, the sound should be heard from your left. In order to create a virtual sound scale, it is important that the positions of sound rotate relative to your head movement.

VR HMD (Head Mount Displays) detects the rotation of the head and changes the sight and rotate the soundscape accordingly.

### Example of hardware that detect head-rotation

### Assignment :
360 spatial audio sound installation with demo on youtube

- create a generative sound installation in Max
    - you can use sound files. However, some programatic aspect should be in it

- An 1 min excerpt of the installation should be uploaded to youtube using [Youtube VR](https://vr.youtube.com/ ) technology

    - the youtube video's visual part should only contain the provided video below
    - the youtube video's audio part should contain 1st order ambisonics sound tracks excerpted from your installation
    - Do not use Head-Locked Stereo
    - the video should be exactly 1 min

- Due date: July. 4. 2022

### How to create your Video

1. Download [FFMpeg](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/) and install
2. Download [Spatial Media Meta Data Injector](https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases)
3. Open Terminal
4. execute following command line
> ffmpeg -i Title.mp4 -i noise_rotation_foa.wav -channel_layout 4.0 -c:v copy -c:a copy test.mov
5. Launch metadata injector and inject meta data
6. Upload to youtube
